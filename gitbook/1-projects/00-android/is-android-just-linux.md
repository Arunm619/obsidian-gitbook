[Is Android really just Linux? - Gary explains - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkP6FTy0a4Y)

### Summary
The video explores whether Android is simply Linux on a smartphone. While Android does use the Linux kernel, it incorporates its own stack and functions, making it a separate operating system. However, Android's compatibility with Linux is evident in certain aspects, highlighting the versatility of the Linux kernel.

### Analogy
Android's relationship with Linux is akin to a cake recipe and its ingredients. While the cake (Android) uses flour (Linux kernel), it also incorporates other elements like sugar, eggs, and flavorings (Android's own stack and functions), making it distinct from just flour itself (Linux).

### Notes
- Android uses the Linux kernel but has its own stack and functions.
- Compatibility exists between Android and Linux, but they are ultimately separate operating systems.
- Android's compatibility with Linux is demonstrated through certain shared functionalities.
