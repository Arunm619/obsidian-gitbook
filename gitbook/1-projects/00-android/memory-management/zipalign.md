 Zipalign is a tool provided by the Android SDK that optimizes the alignment of APK files.
    - APK files are essentially ZIP archives containing various resources and files required for your application.
    - When an APK is not properly aligned, the resources within it may not be optimally mapped into memory when the application is installed and run.
    - Zipalign ensures that the resources within the APK are aligned properly, which allows the system to load them more efficiently into memory.
    - Proper alignment can significantly reduce the memory overhead associated with loading resources, leading to improved runtime performance and lower memory usage.
