Memory Representation
- Primitive - fundamental data types 
	- Int
	- Float
	- Char
- Object - Complex data types (user defined)

```kotlin
class Box {
val width: Int
val height: Int
val length: Int
}
```

```kotlin
val box: Box
```

Objects are stored in heap. 

Two types of memory?
- Stack
- Heap
new objects are created in heap. Memory addresses are returned when new objects are created. Memory address points to location in the heap. 

Memory addresses can be stored in Integers. 
- 32 bit 
- 64 bit

Certain heap space is allocated to our app.
