**Proguard**:
    
    - Proguard is a powerful tool for code shrinking and obfuscation in Android development.
    - Code Shrinking: Proguard analyzes your code and removes any unused classes, methods, and fields. This reduces the overall size of your application, leading to fewer resources being loaded into memory at runtime.
    - Obfuscation: Proguard also obfuscates your code by renaming classes, methods, and fields to obscure their original names. This not only makes reverse engineering more difficult but also helps in reducing the size of the compiled code.
    - By compacting the code and reducing its size, Proguard ultimately reduces the number of RAM pages required to map your application, thereby conserving memory resources.
