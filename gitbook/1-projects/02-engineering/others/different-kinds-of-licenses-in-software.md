Software licenses define the terms and conditions under which users can use, modify, distribute, or redistribute software. There are various types of software licenses, each with its own set of permissions and restrictions. Here are some of the most common types:

1. **Proprietary License**: Also known as closed-source or commercial licenses, these are licenses where the software's source code is not made available to the public, and the rights are retained exclusively by the copyright holder (usually a company). Users are typically granted limited rights to use the software under specific conditions, which may include restrictions on copying, distribution, or modification.

2. **Open Source License**: Open source licenses grant users the right to use, modify, and distribute the software's source code freely. There are various types of open source licenses, including:

    - **Permissive Licenses**: These licenses impose minimal restrictions on how the software can be used, modified, or distributed. Examples include the MIT License and the Apache License.
    
    - **Copyleft Licenses**: These licenses require derivative works to be licensed under the same terms as the original work. Examples include the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Mozilla Public License (MPL).
    
    - **Weak Copyleft Licenses**: These licenses require modifications to the licensed software to be licensed under the same terms as the original work, but they may allow linking with non-copylefted software. An example is the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

3. **Free Software License**: Free software licenses, as defined by the Free Software Foundation, grant users the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the software. The concept of "free" here refers to freedom, not necessarily price. Examples include the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Affero General Public License (AGPL).

4. **Commercial License**: These licenses are typically used for software that is not free or open source and requires payment for use. They often come with various levels of support and maintenance provided by the vendor.

5. **Shareware License**: Shareware licenses allow users to try the software before purchasing it. Users are usually required to pay for continued use after a trial period, or they may have limited functionality in the trial version.

6. **Freeware License**: Freeware licenses allow users to use the software for free, but the source code may not be available, and there may be restrictions on redistribution or modification.

7. **Public Domain License**: Software released into the public domain has no copyright restrictions, and users can do whatever they want with it without any restrictions. However, the concept of public domain varies by jurisdiction, and some countries may not recognize it.




----
There are many software licenses available, each with its own terms and conditions. Here's an exhaustive list of some of the most commonly used ones:

1. **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: This is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software.

2. **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**: This is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component as long as the source code of the component is released.

3. **MIT License**: This is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.

4. **Apache License**: This is a permissive free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It allows users to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software.

5. **Mozilla Public License (MPL)**: This is a free and open-source software license developed and maintained by the Mozilla Foundation.

6. **BSD Licenses**: These are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software. This is in contrast to copyleft licenses, which have reciprocity share-alike requirements.

7. **Eclipse Public License (EPL)**: This is an open-source software license used by the Eclipse Foundation for its software. It replaces the Common Public License (CPL) and removes certain terms relating to litigations.

8. **Creative Commons Licenses**: These are several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted "work". A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they (the author) have created.

9. **Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)**: This is a free and open-source software license released by Microsoft under the Open Source Initiative (OSI). It is a permissive license, but not a copyleft license.

10. **Artistic License**: This is a software license used for certain free and open-source software packages, most notably the standard implementation of the Perl programming language and most CPAN modules, which are dual-licensed under the Artistic License and the GNU General Public License (GPL).

11. **Affero General Public License**: This is a free software license. The Affero GPL is designed to close a perceived legal loophole associated with free software designed to run over a network.

12. **Unlicense**: This is a simple license with no conditions whatsoever which dedicates works to the public domain. Unlicensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.

13. **Boost Software License**: This is a permissive free software license, which has been approved by the Open Source Initiative. The Boost Software License allows for both open-source and closed-source software projects to use Boost.

14. **ISC License**: This is a permissive free software license published by the Internet Systems Consortium. It is functionally equivalent to the simplified BSD and MIT/Expat licenses, with language that was deemed unnecessary removed.

Remember, it's important to choose a license that aligns with your project's goals and requirements. Always review and understand the terms of a software license before using or distributing any software.
