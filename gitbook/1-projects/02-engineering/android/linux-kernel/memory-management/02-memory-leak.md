Memory leaks in Android occur when your application holds onto memory that it no longer needs, preventing that memory from being reclaimed by the system. This can lead to your app using more and more memory, which can eventually lead to performance issues or crashes due to out-of-memory errors.

Here are some common causes of memory leaks in Android:

1. **Static Fields**: If you store an instance of an object in a static field, that object will remain in memory for the lifetime of your application, because static fields are associated with the class, not instances of the class.

2. **Inner Classes and Anonymous Classes**: Non-static inner classes and anonymous classes hold an implicit reference to their outer class. If the inner class is long-lived (for example, if it's a listener or a thread), it can keep the outer class in memory long after it's needed.

3. **Context Leaks**: Contexts in Android are used for many operations, but they also have a lifecycle. If you keep a long-lived reference to a context, you can leak an entire activity, which can be a significant amount of memory.

4. **Listeners and Callbacks**: If you register a listener or callback but don't unregister it when you're done, that can lead to a memory leak. The system or library you registered with will hold onto a reference to your listener, which can keep your object in memory.

5. **Threads**: Threads in Java are garbage collection roots, meaning they and their references are kept in memory until the thread completes. If a thread runs for a long time or indefinitely, it can keep objects in memory.

To prevent memory leaks, you should:

- Be careful with static fields. Only use them when necessary and clear them when you're done.
- Use static inner classes or separate classes instead of non-static inner classes.
- Be careful with contexts. Use the application context instead of an activity context when possible.
- Always unregister listeners and callbacks when you're done with them.
- Be careful with threads. Make sure they complete when they're supposed to.

To detect memory leaks, you can use tools like LeakCanary or the Memory Profiler in Android Studio. These tools can help you find and fix memory leaks in your application.

Here's an example of a memory leak and how to fix it:

```kotlin
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    companion object {
        // This static field will cause a memory leak!
        var leakedView: View? = null
    }

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        leakedView = findViewById(R.id.my_view)
    }
}
```

In this example, `leakedView` is a static field that holds a reference to a view. When the activity is destroyed, the view should be destroyed too, but because it's referenced by a static field, it can't be garbage collected, causing a memory leak.

Here's how to fix it:

```kotlin
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        // Clear the view reference to prevent a memory leak
        leakedView = null
    }
}
```

In the fixed example, we clear the reference to the view in `onDestroy()`, allowing it to be garbage collected when the activity is destroyed.
