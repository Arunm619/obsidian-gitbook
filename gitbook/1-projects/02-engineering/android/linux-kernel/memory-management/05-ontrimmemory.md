`onTrimMemory()` is a callback method that Android calls when the system needs to reclaim memory. This method is part of the `ComponentCallbacks2` interface, which your activity can implement to handle various system events.

The `onTrimMemory()` method receives an integer parameter that indicates the level of memory pressure the system is under. This parameter can be one of several constants defined in the `ComponentCallbacks2` interface, such as `TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW`, `TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN`, or `TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE`.

Here's an example of how you might implement `onTrimMemory()` in an activity:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), ComponentCallbacks2 {

    // ...

    override fun onTrimMemory(level: Int) {
        when (level) {
            ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN -> {
                // UI is now hidden, so we should release resources that only the UI uses.
            }
            ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW, 
            ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL -> {
                // The device is running low on memory. Release any non-critical resources.
            }
            ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND, 
            ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE, 
            ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE -> {
                // The process is not currently needed. You should release all resources.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we're checking the level of memory pressure and taking appropriate action based on that level. For instance, if the UI is hidden, we might release resources that are only used by the UI. If the device is running low on memory, we might release non-critical resources. If the process is not currently needed, we might release all resources.

Remember, the actions you take in `onTrimMemory()` should be appropriate for your app and the resources it uses. The goal is to reduce your app's memory usage when the system is under memory pressure, to help ensure that your app can continue running smoothly and that the system can continue running other apps smoothly as well.
