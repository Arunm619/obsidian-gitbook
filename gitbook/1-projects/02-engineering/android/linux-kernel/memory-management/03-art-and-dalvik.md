Dalvik and ART are Android runtimes. They are responsible for executing the bytecode in Android applications. Here's an in-depth look at both:

**Dalvik**:

Dalvik was the process virtual machine (VM) in Android's core that executed applications written for Android. Dalvik is an interpreter-only virtual machine that executes files in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format, a format that is optimized for efficient storage and memory-mappable execution. 

Key points about Dalvik:

- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler**: Dalvik uses a JIT compiler. JIT compiles parts of the byte code that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. 

- **Memory Management**: Dalvik has its own mechanism for garbage collection, which can sometimes cause pauses during the execution of an app.

- **Performance**: Dalvik was designed to run on devices with low memory and processing power. It's quite efficient in terms of memory management, but it can be slower than ART in terms of execution speed.

**Android Runtime (ART)**:

ART was introduced as a new runtime from Android 4.4 (KitKat) and became the only runtime option from Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and onwards. ART brought a significant change in the way applications are executed.

Key points about ART:

- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler**: ART uses an AOT compiler that compiles the bytecode into machine code upon installation of an application. This means that when you open an app, the compiled machine code is executed directly, which leads to faster execution times.

- **Garbage Collection**: ART has improved garbage collection compared to Dalvik, which reduces the pauses during app execution and helps the app run smoothly.

- **Performance**: ART generally provides better performance than Dalvik, as it uses AOT compilation, improved garbage collection, and improved debugging support.

**Comparison**:

- **Compilation**: Dalvik uses JIT compilation, which happens during the app's runtime. ART uses AOT compilation, which happens at the time of app installation.

- **Performance**: ART generally provides better performance than Dalvik, due to AOT compilation and improved garbage collection.

- **App Startup Time**: Apps start faster on ART due to AOT compilation.

- **Memory Usage**: ART requires more storage space than Dalvik because it compiles the bytecode into machine code upon app installation, and stores that machine code for later use.

**Advantages and Disadvantages**:

- **Dalvik Advantages**: Efficient in terms of memory usage. Better for devices with low memory and processing power.

- **Dalvik Disadvantages**: Slower execution speed compared to ART. Uses JIT compilation which can lead to longer app startup times.

- **ART Advantages**: Faster execution speed. Improved garbage collection leads to smoother app performance. Better debugging support.

- **ART Disadvantages**: Requires more storage space. The AOT compilation process increases the app installation time.

As an Android developer, it's important to understand that while you can write more efficient code by understanding the runtime, the choice between Dalvik and ART is not up to you, but up to the users and their Android OS version. From Android 5.0 Lollipop and onwards, ART is the only runtime option.
