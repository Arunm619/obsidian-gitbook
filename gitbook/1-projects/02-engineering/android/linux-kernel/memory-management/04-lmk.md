The Low Memory Killer (LMK) is a component of Android that works at the kernel level to manage memory. It's designed to maintain a balance between the available memory and the memory that applications need. When the system runs low on memory, the LMK selectively kills processes to free up memory based on their importance.

Here's how it works:

1. **Monitoring Memory**: The LMK continuously monitors the amount of free memory in the system. It gets notified when the free memory falls below a certain threshold.

2. **Determining Processes to Kill**: When the free memory falls below the threshold, the LMK determines which processes to kill based on their oom_adj value (Out of Memory adjustment). The oom_adj value is a score that indicates the importance of a process. Lower values indicate more important processes, and higher values indicate less important processes. The LMK prefers to kill processes with higher oom_adj values (i.e., less important processes).

3. **Killing Processes**: Once the LMK has determined which processes to kill, it sends a SIGKILL signal to those processes. This signal cannot be caught or ignored, so it immediately terminates the process and frees up its memory.

4. **Adjusting the Threshold**: The LMK adjusts the free memory threshold based on the system's memory usage patterns. If the system frequently falls below the threshold, the LMK may increase the threshold to keep more free memory available.

The LMK is a critical component of Android's memory management system. It helps ensure that the system has enough memory to function properly, even under heavy load. However, it's important to note that the LMK is a last resort for freeing up memory. Android uses other memory management techniques, such as garbage collection and memory compaction, before resorting to killing processes.

As an Android developer, you don't have direct control over the LMK. However, you can influence which of your app's processes are more likely to be killed by the LMK by managing your app's memory usage and setting appropriate oom_adj values for your app's processes.
