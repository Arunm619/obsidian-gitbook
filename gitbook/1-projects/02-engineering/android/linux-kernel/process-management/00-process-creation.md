In Android, the process creation is handled by the Linux kernel, but the decision of when to create a new process is made by the Android runtime. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Launching an Application**: When a user launches an application, the Android system starts a new process for the application, with a single thread of execution (the "main" thread). This is done by the Linux kernel at the request of the Android runtime.

2. **Instantiating Application Components**: Each component (Activity, Service, BroadcastReceiver, ContentProvider) of the application is instantiated as needed within this process. The system loads the application's classes into the new Linux process. 

3. **Creating the Application Object**: The system instantiates the Application class (or a custom subclass of the Application class, if the application has defined one) and calls its onCreate() method. This is the first code that is executed within the process.

4. **Starting the Main Thread**: The main thread, also known as the UI thread, is created. This thread is very important because it is in charge of dispatching events to the appropriate user interface widgets, including drawing events. It is also the thread in which your application interacts with components from the Android UI toolkit.

5. **Starting an Activity**: If the application component that initiated the process is an Activity, the system instantiates the Activity and calls its onCreate() method, passing it a Bundle that contains any state saved from the activity's previous incarnation.
6. Activity Lifecycle: The Activity goes through various lifecycle stages (onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, onDestroy). The Android system calls these lifecycle methods, allowing the developer to specify how the application behaves when the Activity is visible or not visible to the user, when the Activity is in the foreground, or when the system is about to kill the process.  
7. Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Android provides several ways for apps to communicate with each other, such as Intents, Bundles, and Binders. Intents are used for asynchronous communication between components (like starting an Activity or Service). Bundles are used to pass data between components. Binders allow for direct function calls between processes, with the system handling all the details of inter-process communication.  
8. Process Termination: The Android system tries to maintain an application process for as long as possible, but eventually needs to remove old processes when memory runs low. To determine which processes to keep and which to kill, the system places each process into an "importance hierarchy" based on the components running in it and the state of those components. Processes with the lowest importance are eliminated first.


Here's a simple example of how an Activity is created in Android:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        // Initialize your UI components and other objects here
    }

    override fun onStart() {
        super.onStart()
        // The activity is about to become visible
    }

    override fun onResume() {
        super.onResume()
        // The activity has become visible (it is now "resumed")
    }

    override fun onPause() {
        super.onPause()
        // Another activity is taking focus (this activity is about to be "paused")
    }

    override fun onStop() {
        super.onStop()
        // The activity is no longer visible (it is now "stopped")
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        // The activity is about to be destroyed
    }
}
```

In this example, `MainActivity` is an Activity that is created when the application process is started. The `onCreate()` method is called by the system, and the layout defined in `activity_main.xml` is set as the content view.
