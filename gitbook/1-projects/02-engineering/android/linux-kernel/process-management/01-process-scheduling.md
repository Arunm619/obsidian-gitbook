Process scheduling in Android is handled by the Linux kernel, which uses a **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)** to manage process scheduling. The CFS ensures that each process gets a fair share of the CPU, based on their priority.

In Android, each application runs in its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine (or ART in newer versions of Android). Each process is given a certain amount of time to run on the CPU, after which it is moved to the background so that other processes can run.

The scheduling of processes in Android is based on a priority system. The priority of a process is determined by the importance of the task that it is performing. For example, a process that is in the foreground and interacting with the user will have a higher priority than a process that is performing a background task.

The Linux kernel uses a preemptive, priority-based scheduling algorithm. This means that if a higher priority process becomes ready to run, the currently running process can be preempted (i.e., moved to the background) so that the higher priority process can run.

Here's a brief overview of the priority levels in Android:

1. **Foreground Process**: A process that is needed for what the user is currently doing. This could be an activity that the user is interacting with, a service that is executing a lifecycle callback, or a broadcast receiver that is running its `onReceive()` method.

2. **Visible Process**: A process that doesn't have any foreground components but can still affect what the user sees on the screen.

3. **Service Process**: A process that is running a service that has been started with the `startService()` method.

4. **Background Process**: A process that is holding an activity that is not currently visible to the user.

5. **Empty Process**: A process that doesn't hold any active application components. These processes are kept around as caches to improve startup time.

The Android system tries to keep as many processes in memory as it can, but when memory is low, it will begin to stop and kill processes, starting with those with the lowest priority.

It's important to note that as an Android developer, you don't have direct control over process scheduling. The Android system handles this for you. However, understanding how process scheduling works can help you make better decisions about how to structure your application and manage its resources.

Android, being a Linux-based operating system, inherits the Linux kernel's process scheduling mechanism. However, Android has made several modifications to better suit its needs for a mobile operating system. 

1. **Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**: The Linux kernel uses a scheduling algorithm called the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). The CFS aims to provide a fair amount of CPU time to each process based on its priority. The priority of a process in Linux is determined by its nice value, which ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). 

2. **Android Process Priority**: Android, however, uses a different set of priorities. It categorizes processes into different classes based on their importance to the user experience and assigns them different oom_adj values (Out of Memory adjustment). The oom_adj value ranges from -17 (never kill) to 15 (always kill when out of memory). The lower the oom_adj value, the higher the priority of the process.

3. **Foreground Process**: A process that is interacting with the user. This includes the activity the user is interacting with, a service running a lifecycle callback, and a broadcast receiver running its `onReceive()` method. These processes have the highest priority and are the last to be killed.

4. **Visible Process**: A process that doesn't have any foreground components but can still affect what the user sees on the screen. These processes are considered extremely important and are only killed as a last resort.

5. **Service Process**: A process that is running a service that has been started with the `startService()` method. These processes are also considered important, but not as important as foreground or visible processes.

6. **Background Process**: A process that is holding an activity that is not currently visible to the user. These processes are killed as needed to reclaim resources.

7. **Empty Process**: A process that doesn't hold any active application components. These processes are kept around as caches to improve startup time and are killed as needed to reclaim resources.

8. **Process Scheduling and Multitasking**: Android uses Linux's preemptive multitasking, which means that at any given time, the CPU is executing a single task. However, it switches between tasks so quickly that it gives the illusion of parallel execution. The task to be executed next is determined by the scheduler based on the priority of the tasks.

9. **Binder IPC**: Android's inter-process communication (IPC) is handled by the Binder, a custom Android IPC mechanism. The Binder allows for direct function calls between processes, with the system handling all the details of inter-process communication. This is crucial for process scheduling as it allows high-priority processes to make function calls to lower-priority processes without being blocked.

10. **Low Memory Killer (LMK)**: When the system runs low on memory, it triggers the Low Memory Killer, which kills processes based on their oom_adj value, starting with the ones with the highest value (lowest priority).

As an Android developer, understanding these concepts can help you design your app to provide a smooth user experience, even under heavy system load or low memory conditions. However, the Android system handles most of these details for you, so you can focus on building your app's functionality.
