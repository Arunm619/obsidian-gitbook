Sure, here's a brief overview of the four main components of Android architecture:

1. **Activities**: An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface. It's where your UI lives and user interaction happens. Each activity is independent of others and can be started or stopped independently.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    }
}
```

2. **Services**: A Service is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. It doesn't provide a user interface.

```kotlin
class MyService : Service() {
    override fun onBind(intent: Intent): IBinder? {
        return null
    }
}
```

3. **Broadcast Receivers**: Broadcast Receivers respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Many broadcasts originate from the systemâ€”for example, a broadcast announcing that the screen has turned off, the battery is low, or a picture was captured.

```kotlin
class MyReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        Toast.makeText(context, "Broadcast Received", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```

4. **Content Providers**: A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access.

```kotlin
class MyContentProvider : ContentProvider() {
    override fun onCreate(): Boolean {
        return false
    }

    // Implement other required methods...
}
```

These components are the building blocks of any Android application. They can communicate with each other using Intents, and each has a specific role in the overall lifecycle of an application.
