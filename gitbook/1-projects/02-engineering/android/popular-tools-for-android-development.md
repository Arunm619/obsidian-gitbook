Android development involves a variety of tools that help in creating high-quality apps efficiently. Here are some popular ones:

1. **Android Studio**: This is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development. It provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device. It offers features like visual layout, APK analyzer, intelligent code editor, flexible build system, and real-time profilers.

2. **Gradle**: This is an open-source build automation system that is used in Android Studio. It uses domain-specific language rather than XML form for project configuration. Gradle allows developers to write in a language they are comfortable with, such as Java, C++, or Python.

3. **Kotlin**: This is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and can be used to develop Android apps. It is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library.

4. **Java**: This is a popular programming language for Android development. It is object-oriented and allows developers to "write once, run anywhere".

5. **Firebase**: This is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) that provides developers with a variety of tools and services to help them develop quality apps, grow their user base, and earn profits. It is built on Google infrastructure and scales automatically.

6. **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**: This is a command-line tool that lets developers communicate with an emulator instance or connected Android device. It is a client-server program that includes three components: a client, a daemon, and a server.

7. **Genymotion**: This is a fast, cross-platform Android emulator that comes with pre-configured Android images. It is very powerful and easy to use, and it allows developers to test their Android apps on various virtual devices for development, testing, and demonstration purposes.

8. **Junit**: This is a simple framework for writing and running repeatable tests in Java. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

9. **Espresso**: This is a testing framework for Android to make it easy to write reliable user interface tests. It automatically synchronizes your test actions with the user interface of your app.

10. **ProGuard**: This is a tool that shrinks, optimizes, and obfuscates your code by removing unused code and renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure names. It makes your APK file as small as possible.

11. **LeakCanary**: This is a memory leak detection library for Android and Java. It makes it easier to detect and fix memory leaks in your app.

12. **Mockito**: This is a mocking framework that lets you write beautiful tests with a clean & simple API. It allows you to write tests with a clean and simple API.

These tools are widely used in the Android development ecosystem and can greatly enhance productivity and efficiency when building apps.

### Popular Android Libraries

There are numerous libraries available that can help streamline Android app development. Here are some of the most popular ones:

1. **Retrofit**: This is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST-based web service.

2. **Glide**: This is a fast and efficient open-source media management and image loading framework for Android. It wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy-to-use interface.

3. **Room**: This is a persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite. It allows for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

4. **Dagger**: This is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version created by Square and now maintained by Google.

5. **RxJava**: This is a Java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions, which is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

6. **Moshi**: This is a modern JSON library for Android and Java. It makes it easy to parse JSON into Java objects. It has fewer methods than Gson, making it a good alternative.

7. **OkHttp**: This is an open-source project designed to be an efficient HTTP and HTTP/2 client. It lets you efficiently upload and download files, send GET and POST requests, and even inspect your request and response headers.

8. **Picasso**: This is a powerful image downloading and caching library for Android. It simplifies the process of loading images from external URLs and display on your application.

9. **LeakCanary**: This is a memory leak detection library for Android and Java. It makes it easier to detect and fix memory leaks in your app.

10. **Espresso**: This is a testing framework for Android to make it easy to write reliable user interface tests. It automatically synchronizes your test actions with the user interface of your app.

These libraries are widely used in the Android development ecosystem and can greatly enhance productivity and efficiency when building apps.
