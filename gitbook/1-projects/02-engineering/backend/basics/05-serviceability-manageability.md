Serviceability or Manageability in software systems refers to how easily a system can be managed, monitored, and updated. 
This includes aspects like logging, monitoring, debugging, and updating the system.  In the context of a backend system written in Kotlin or Java, you might use various tools and practices to improve serviceability:  

- **Logging**: Proper logging is crucial for understanding the behavior of an application and for debugging purposes. 
- **Monitoring**: Monitoring tools help you keep an eye on your system's performance and health. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic can be used to monitor Java or Kotlin applications.  
- **Debugging**: Debugging tools are essential for finding and fixing issues in your code. Most IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA provide powerful debugging tools for Java and Kotlin.  
- **Updating**: The ability to update your system with minimal downtime is crucial for serviceability. Techniques like Blue-Green deployment or Canary deployment can help with this.

**Prometheus**: Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, primarily used for recording real-time metrics in a time-series database.

**Grafana**: Grafana is a multi-platform open-source analytics and visualization platform that allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.

**New Relic**: New Relic is a software analytics company that provides insights into software performance and real-time user behavior, helping businesses to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their software applications.

**What is Time series database?**
A time series database (TSDB) is a software system that is optimized for handling time series data, arrays of numbers indexed by time. A time series is simply a series of data points ordered in time. In a time series, time is often the independent variable and the goal is usually to make a forecast for the future.

Time series databases are specifically built for handling metrics that change over time, such as network traffic, server load, CPU usage, and temperature readings. They have built-in functions for aggregation, down-sampling, and gap filling.

Examples of time series databases include InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, and the Prometheus system's storage layer.

Blue-Green and Canary deployments are strategies used to release new versions of an application with minimal downtime and reduced risk.

**Blue-Green Deployment**: In this strategy, two environments (Blue and Green) are maintained. At any time, one (Blue) is live and serving all production traffic, while the other (Green) is idle. When a new version of the application is ready, it's deployed to the idle environment (Green). After testing the new version on the Green environment, the traffic is switched over. If something goes wrong, you can switch back to the Blue environment, ensuring minimal downtime.

**Canary Deployment**: This strategy is named after the "canary in a coal mine" concept. Instead of switching all traffic to the new version of the application, only a small subset of traffic is directed to the new version (the canary). The new version is monitored for any issues. If everything works fine, the rest of the traffic is gradually directed to the new version. If something goes wrong, it affects only a small number of users, and the new version can be taken down.

Both strategies aim to reduce the risk of deploying a new version and to minimize downtime. They require a certain level of automation and infrastructure setup to work effectively.
