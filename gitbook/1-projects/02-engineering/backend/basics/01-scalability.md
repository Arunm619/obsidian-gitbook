- The capability of a system to grow and manage increased demand. 
- A system that can continuously evolve to support growing amount of work is scalable.
- Horizontal scaling: by adding more servers into the pool of resources.
- Vertical scaling: by adding more resource (CPU, RAM, storage, etc) to an existing server. This approach comes with downtime and an upper limit.

Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. In the context of software engineering, it refers to the capability of a system to handle an increasing amount of requests without compromising performance.

There are two types of scalability:

1. **Horizontal Scalability**: This involves adding more machines into your pool of resources. It's also known as scaling out. An example of this is adding more servers to distribute load.

2. **Vertical Scalability**: This involves adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. It's also known as scaling up. An example of this is upgrading a server with a powerful CPU, more RAM, and increased disk capacity.

In backend engineering, scalability is a crucial aspect to consider, especially for applications expected to serve a large number of users. Scalable systems are more capable of handling high load by distributing it across multiple servers or improving the resources of a single server.

Here's a simple example of horizontal scalability with a load balancer in front of multiple servers:

```
User Request -> Load Balancer -> Server 1
                             -> Server 2
                             -> Server 3
```

In this scenario, the load balancer distributes incoming user requests to multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed with too many requests. This is an example of horizontal scalability.

Let's look at some examples of how scalability and reliability are implemented in real-world software systems:

**Scalability**

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Auto Scaling**: AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. It's a clear example of horizontal scalability. AWS Auto Scaling makes scaling simple with recommendations that allow you to optimize performance, costs, or balance between them.

2. **Google's Bigtable**: Google's Bigtable is a distributed storage system designed to handle large amounts of structured data. It's used by many Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail. Bigtable is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers.

**Reliability**

1. **Netflix's Chaos Monkey**: Netflix developed a tool called Chaos Monkey that randomly terminates instances in production to ensure that engineers implement their services to be resilient to instance failures. This is a great example of how to ensure reliability through fault tolerance.

2. **Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**: Google's SRE implements DevOps principles and practices and is responsible for ensuring that all of Google's services are reliable and run smoothly. The team has a set of principles, including reducing organizational silos, accepting failure as normal, implementing gradual changes, leveraging tooling and automation, and measuring everything.

In the context of a backend system written in Kotlin or Java, you might use frameworks and libraries that support these strategies. For instance, Spring Boot, a popular framework for building Java applications, provides features for building highly available, fault-tolerant systems. 

For scalability, you can use the `@Async` annotation in Spring Boot to easily create asynchronous methods in your application. Here's a simple example:

```java
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableAsync;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@EnableAsync
@Service
public class AsyncService {

    @Async
    public void asyncMethod() {
        // Your time-consuming logic here
    }
}
```

In this example, `asyncMethod` will be executed in a separate thread allowing the caller to continue with other tasks in parallel.

For reliability, you can use Spring Retry which provides declarative control of the retry operations. Here's a simple example:

```java
import org.springframework.retry.annotation.Backoff;
import org.springframework.retry.annotation.Retryable;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class RetryService {

    @Retryable(value = {Exception.class}, maxAttempts = 3, backoff = @Backoff(delay = 1000))
    public void retryableMethod() {
        // Your logic here
    }
}
```

In this example, `retryableMethod` will be retried up to 3 times if it fails, with a delay of 1 second between attempts. This can be useful when interacting with external systems that might be temporarily unavailable.
