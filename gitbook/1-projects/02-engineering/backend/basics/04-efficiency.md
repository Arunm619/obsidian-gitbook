Latency: response time, the delay to obtain the first piece of data.
Bandwidth: throughput, amount of data delivered in a given time.

Efficiency in the context of software systems often refers to the optimal use of resources to perform a certain task. It can be measured in terms of time complexity (how execution time grows with the size of the input), space complexity (how memory usage grows with the size of the input), and other factors like network usage, disk I/O, etc.

**Latency** and **bandwidth** are two key factors that affect the efficiency of network communication:

1. **Latency**: Latency is the time it takes for a packet of data to get from one designated point to another in a network. In other words, it's the delay between the sender and the receiver decoding it. This delay happens because the packet of data needs to travel from the sender to the receiver, which might involve multiple hops between different network devices. High latency can lead to a delay in communication and can affect the performance of your application, especially in real-time applications like video streaming or online gaming.

2. **Bandwidth**: Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. It's usually measured in bits per second (bps). Bandwidth is like a pipe, the bigger the pipe (more bandwidth), the more data you can send through it at once. Limited bandwidth can lead to slower data transfer speeds and longer times to complete tasks.

In the context of a backend system written in Kotlin or Java, you might use various strategies to optimize latency and bandwidth usage. For instance, you can use data compression to reduce the size of the data being transferred, caching to avoid unnecessary data transfers, or batch processing to reduce the number of network requests.


Caching in a distributed system can be implemented using various strategies, such as in-memory databases (like Redis or Memcached), distributed cache (like Hazelcast), or HTTP caching (like Varnish or Squid). The goal is to store frequently accessed data closer to the application, reducing the need for expensive database or network operations and thus improving efficiency and reducing network latency
