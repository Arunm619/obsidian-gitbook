- Reliability is the probability that a system will fail in a given period.
- A distributed system is reliable if it keeps delivering its service even when one or multiple components fail.
- Reliability is achieved through redundancy of components and data (remove every single point of failure).

Reliability in the context of software engineering refers to the ability of a system or component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time. It's about ensuring that the software is available and operational when it's needed.

Reliability can be broken down into several key aspects:

1. **Availability**: 
- The system is up and running when users need to use it. This is often measured as a percentage of uptime in a given period.
- This is the measure of a system's uptime. It's usually expressed as a percentage, with 100% meaning the system is always operational.
- For example, a system with 99.999% availability is said to have "five nines" of availability, meaning it's down for no more than 5.26 minutes per year. High availability is achieved through redundancy, monitoring, and failover capabilities.

3. **Recoverability**: 
- The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 
- This refers to how quickly a system can recover from a failure or disaster. This could be a hardware failure, software bug, or even a natural disaster.
- Techniques for improving recoverability include regular backups, disaster recovery planning, and using distributed systems that can failover to a backup system in case of a failure.

3. **Fault Tolerance**: 
- The ability of a system to continue to operate correctly even in the presence of failures. This often involves redundancy, where multiple instances of the same component are used so that if one fails, others can take over.
- This is the ability of a system to continue functioning even when part of it fails. This is achieved through redundancy, where multiple instances of the same component are used so that if one fails, others can take over. 
- For example, a load balancer might distribute requests across multiple servers, so if one server fails, the others can continue to handle requests. 

4. **Data Integrity**: 
   - Ensuring that the data in the system is accurate, consistent, and accessible.
   - This ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and accessible. It involves both preventing accidental modification or deletion of data, and ensuring that if data is intentionally modified, the changes are correct and consistent across the system.
   - Techniques for ensuring data integrity include validation checks, database transactions, and access controls.

5. **Robustness**: 
- The ability of a system to cope with errors during execution and cope with erroneous input.
- This is the ability of a system to handle errors or unexpected input gracefully. A robust system doesn't crash or produce incorrect results when faced with unexpected conditions. 
- This is achieved through careful error handling, input validation, and testing.

In backend engineering, reliability is crucial as it directly impacts the user experience. If a backend system is not reliable, it could lead to downtime, data loss, or incorrect functionality, all of which can negatively impact users. 

For example, in a banking application, reliability would mean that transactions are processed accurately, the balance is always correct, and the system is available when users need to access their accounts. If the system is not reliable, it could lead to incorrect balances, failed transactions, or inability to access the system, which would be a major problem for users.

#### Measuring Reliability 

- **Mean time between failures**: Calculate this by dividing the total operation time by the number of failures.
- **Failure rate**: Calculate this by dividing the number of failures by the total time in service.
