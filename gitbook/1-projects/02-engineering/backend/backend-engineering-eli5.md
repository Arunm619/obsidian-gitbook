Backend engineering refers to server-side development. This is the part of the web that you cannot see and interact with. It handles the 'behind-the-scenes' functionality of web applications. It's responsible for managing the database through queries and APIs, backend logic, server configuration, and the like.

Here are some key concepts:

1. **Server**: This is a computer that's responsible for serving web pages. Whenever your browser sends a request for a page, the server processes this request and returns the requested page to the browser.

2. **Database**: This is where all the data is stored. The backend communicates with the database to retrieve, save, or update data.

3. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: This is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines methods of communication between various software components.

4. **HTTP Methods**: These are a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. These methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), etc.

5. **Middleware**: This is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. It's used to process incoming requests before they reach your application code.

6. **Routes**: These are the different paths to which the API responds. For example, in a blog application, you might have routes for creating a new post, deleting a post, updating a post, etc.

Let's take a look at a simple example of a backend server using Java and the Spring Boot framework:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
public class BackendApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(BackendApplication.class, args);
    }

    @RestController
    class HelloController {

        @GetMapping("/")
        public String hello() {
            return "Hello, World!";
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a simple server that listens for GET requests at the root ("/") route and responds with "Hello, World!". This is a very basic example, but it gives you an idea of how a backend server might be set up.

Remember, backend engineering is a vast field and there's a lot more to learn. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I hope this gives you a good starting point.
