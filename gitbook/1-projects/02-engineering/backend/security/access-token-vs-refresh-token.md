**Access Token:**
An access token is a credential that can be used by an application to access an API. It can be any type of token (such as an opaque string or a JWT) and is meant for an API. Its purpose is to inform the API that the bearer of this token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that has been granted.

**Usage:**
Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API. The passed token informs the API that the bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions. 

**Refresh Token:**
A refresh token is a special kind of token that can be used to obtain a renewed access token. You can request new access tokens until the refresh token is blacklisted. Refresh tokens must be stored securely by an application because they essentially allow a user to remain authenticated forever.

**Usage:**
A refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope. Refresh tokens are usually subject to strict storage requirements to ensure they are not leaked.

**Practical Example:**
Here's a simplified example of how these tokens might be used in practice:

```kotlin
// User logs in with credentials
val loginResponse = authService.login(username, password)

// Extract the access and refresh tokens from the response
val accessToken = loginResponse.accessToken
val refreshToken = loginResponse.refreshToken

// Use the access token to access protected routes
val userResponse = userService.getUserDetails(accessToken)

// If the access token is expired, use the refresh token to get a new one
if (userResponse == "Access token expired") {
    val refreshResponse = authService.refresh(refreshToken)
    accessToken = refreshResponse.accessToken
    // Retry the request with the new access token
    userResponse = userService.getUserDetails(accessToken)
}
```
In this example, the `authService` is responsible for handling authentication, including logging in and refreshing tokens. The `userService` is a protected service that requires an access token to authorize requests.
