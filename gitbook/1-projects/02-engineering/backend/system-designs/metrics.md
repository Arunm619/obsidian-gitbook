#### QPS 

Queries per second (QPS) is a measure of how much traffic a particular query server is handling at a given time. It's commonly used in the context of databases and search engines, where it refers to the number of queries that can be executed per second. This metric is important for understanding the load on a server and for capacity planning. High QPS values indicate heavy load and may require server optimization or scaling strategies to handle effectively.
