#### Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements

**Functional Requirements**: These are the requirements that define the specific behavior or functions of the system. They describe what the system should do and include specifications for features, capabilities, and security. For example, in a banking application, a functional requirement might be that the system must allow users to check their account balance.

**Non-Functional Requirements**: These are the requirements that define the system's properties or characteristics, such as performance, reliability, usability, etc. They describe how the system should work. For example, in the same banking application, a non-functional requirement might be that the system must respond to user requests within a certain time frame (performance), or that it must be available 99.9% of the time (reliability).

In summary, while functional requirements are about what the system should do, non-functional requirements are about how the system should do it. Both are crucial for the successful development and operation of a system.
