Machine Learning, or ML, is like teaching your computer to do something by itself. Imagine if you have a big box of different fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges, and you want to sort them. You could do it yourself, but it would be cool if your computer could do it for you, right?

So, you start by showing your computer some pictures of apples, bananas, and oranges, and tell it which fruit is which. This is called "training". After showing it enough pictures, your computer will start to notice patterns - like apples are usually red, bananas are yellow and long, and oranges are round and orange.

Once it has learned these patterns, you can show it a new picture of a fruit that it hasn't seen before, and it will be able to tell you whether it's an apple, a banana, or an orange. This is called "prediction".

And that's what Machine Learning is - it's about teaching computers to recognize patterns and make predictions based on what they've learned.
