### 1. Register Curiosity 

Humans are curious by nature 
They want to know why something is the way it is. How its works all those stuff. 
But we lack time. We have so much things to do. 
So registering the curiosity works wonders.

Whenever something intrigues you just make a note of it in your note taking app. 
Along with it add the reason for why you want to know that. 

Knowing that why part is important to push yourself.

when we have time, we can revisit that. 


### 2. Jump start. 
Human beings are lazy as fuck. We like to defer things. Procastinate. This is very natural. 

 When you want something, try to get rid of something. Just start man. 
0-1 journey. Just get started. Dont wait to find the best resource. 

When you are at absolute zero does it matter if you get best resource or not? just get started. 
 Start with everything and anything that you have. 

### 3. Do the laundry

Just do it. Don't think about it. 
We like to live in a beautiful world made up in our head. 
Building stuff in head != not getting things done. 

Just get stuff done. Do the fucking laundry. 

Implement the core logic of something that you don't understand by hand yourself to get the hang of it.

### 4. Inverse power law

Don't get into the super advanced topic. Go with first principles approach.
Go with basics and get the foundational stuff strong and then move on to advanced incrementally.

ChatGPT <-> LLM 
No basics of Neural networks
No basics of calculus 

No comprehension of LLM working!

Start with basics always.


### 5. Juggle and time-box

we underestimate how many things we can do in parallel. 

ELON MUSK - what did you get done this week?


Dont keep jumping ships as you find things intriguing. 
Pick 2 or 3 only. Learn in parallel. 

Significant progress in both of them. You would do justice to your decision. 

If you find it boring, eg. maths is not my cup of tea. 
Time box every single thing. 
3m for golang. 1m is enough decide to extend it or not.

if something is boring, whats the alternative? 
Instagram scrolling..... Don't do that. thats why have 2. 

Its okay to drop something. 
its okay to be bored. 
its okay to say not my cup of tea.
