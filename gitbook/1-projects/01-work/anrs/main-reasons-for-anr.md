- **Input dispatching timed out:** If your app has not responded to an input event (such as key press or screen touch) within 5 seconds.
- **Executing service:** If a service declared by your app cannot finish executing `Service.onCreate()` and `Service.onStartCommand()`/`Service.onBind()` within a few seconds.
- **Service.startForeground() not called:** If your app uses `Context.startForegroundService()` to start a new service in the foreground, but the service then does not call `startForeground()` within 5 seconds.
- **Broadcast of intent:** If a [`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver) hasn't finished executing within a set amount of time. If the app has any activity in the foreground, this timeout is 5 seconds.
- **JobScheduler interactions:** If a [`JobService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobService) does not return from `JobService.onStartJob()` or `JobService.onStopJob()` within a few seconds, or if a [user-initiated job](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobParameters#isUserInitiatedJob()) starts and your app doesn't call `JobService.setNotification()` within a few seconds after `JobService.onStartJob()` was called. For apps targeting Android 13 and below, the ANRs are silent and not reported to the app. For apps targeting Android 14 and above, the ANRs are explicit and are reported to the app.
