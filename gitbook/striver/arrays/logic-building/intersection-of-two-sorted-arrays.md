### **Question**:

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array containing the intersection of these two arrays.

The intersection of two arrays is an array where all values are present in both arrays. Each element in the result must be unique.

---

### **Intuition**:

- **Sorted Arrays**: Since both arrays are sorted, we can use the two-pointer technique to efficiently find common elements.
- **Two-Pointer Approach**: We can iterate through both arrays with two pointers, one for each array, and compare the current elements. If they match, it's an intersection; if not, move the pointer in the array with the smaller current element.
- **Set or Hashing**: Alternatively, we can use a set to store elements from one array and check if elements from the second array are present in the set.

---

### **Solution (All Approaches)**:

#### **Approach 1: Two Pointer Technique**

- Since the arrays are sorted, the two-pointer technique is optimal. We initialize pointers for both arrays (`i` for `nums1` and `j` for `nums2`), and move them based on comparisons:
    - If `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`, it is part of the intersection. Add it to the result and move both pointers forward.
    - If `nums1[i] < nums2[j]`, move pointer `i` forward.
    - If `nums1[i] > nums2[j]`, move pointer `j` forward.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n+m)O(n + m), where nn and mm are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min⁡(n,m))O(\min(n, m)) for storing the intersection.

#### **Approach 2: Hashing/Set**

- We can insert elements of the smaller array into a set, and then iterate through the larger array to check if each element is present in the set.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n+m)O(n + m), but with additional space complexity due to the set.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min⁡(n,m))O(\min(n, m)), for the set.

### **Implementation**:

#### **Approach 1: Two Pointer Technique**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        vector<int> result;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < nums1.size() && j < nums2.size()) {
            if (nums1[i] == nums2[j]) {
                result.push_back(nums1[i]);
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### **Approach 2: Hashing/Set**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        unordered_set<int> set(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        vector<int> result;
        for (int num : nums2) {
            if (set.count(num)) {
                result.push_back(num);
                set.erase(num); // Remove to ensure uniqueness in the result
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### **Edge Cases**:

1. **One of the arrays is empty**: If either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty, the intersection is also empty.
2. **No intersection**: If there are no common elements between the two arrays, return an empty array.
3. **All elements are the same**: If both arrays are identical, the intersection will be the array itself.
4. **Multiple duplicates in one array**: Ensure only unique elements are added to the result.

### **Time Complexity and Space Complexity**:

| Approach                  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| **Two Pointer Technique** | O(n+m)          | O(1)             |
| **Hashing/Set**           | O(n+m)          | O(n)             |

---

### **Key Takeaways from this Problem**:

1. **Optimized Using Sorting**: The two-pointer approach works optimally when the arrays are already sorted. In problems where the arrays aren't sorted, sorting them first might still result in an efficient solution.
2. **Handling Uniqueness**: Be mindful of ensuring the uniqueness of elements when necessary. For example, in the hashing approach, we remove the element from the set once it is found in the intersection.
3. **Space Complexity Considerations**: The set-based solution uses extra space to store the elements of one array, while the two-pointer technique works in-place without extra space.

---

### **Mistakes and Challenges from this Problem**:

1. **Overcomplicating the Solution**: It's easy to think of sorting or using complex data structures, but the two-pointer approach is often the simplest and most efficient for sorted arrays.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: It’s important to handle cases like empty arrays, arrays with no intersection, and arrays with duplicate elements correctly.

### **Real-World Application of this Problem**:

1. **Database Queries**: Finding the intersection of two sets of data, such as querying two different datasets to find common records.
2. **File Synchronization**: When syncing files, determining which files are present in both directories could be an example of intersection.
3. **Common Interests**: In a social media platform, finding common friends or mutual interests between two users.

**TIME and SPACE**
### **Approach 1: Two Pointer Technique**

- **Time Complexity**:
    - We traverse both arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`) using two pointers. Each pointer moves at most `n` or `m` steps, where `n` and `m` are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.
    - Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n + m)**.
- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is **O(1)**, because we only use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers (`i` and `j`), regardless of the input size.
    - The output `result` vector stores the intersection, but that’s part of the final result and does not contribute to extra space usage.

---

### **Approach 2: Hashing/Set**

- **Time Complexity**:
    - We first insert all elements of `nums1` into a set, which takes **O(n)** time.
    - Then, for each element in `nums2`, we check its presence in the set, which takes **O(1)** time for each lookup. Since `nums2` has `m` elements, the total time for this step is **O(m)**.
    - Therefore, the total time complexity is **O(n + m)**.
- **Space Complexity**:
    - We store all elements of `nums1` in a set, which requires **O(n)** space.
    - The space complexity is therefore **O(n)**, as the set is the only additional data structure used.
