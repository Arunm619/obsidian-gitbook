Here’s a detailed solutioning document for rotating a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise:

---

### **Question**

Given an n×nn \times n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise in-place.

For example:  
Input:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \end{bmatrix}
$$
Output:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 7 & 4 & 1 \\ 8 & 5 & 2 \\ 9 & 6 & 3 \\ \end{bmatrix}
$$
---

### **Intuition**

The key observation is that rotating a matrix clockwise by 90 degrees is equivalent to:

1. **Transposing the matrix**: Converting rows into columns.
2. **Reversing each row**: Reversing the order of elements in each row.

These operations can be performed in-place without additional space.

---

### **Solution (All Approaches)**

#### **Approach 1: In-place Transpose and Reverse**

1. Transpose the matrix by swapping matrix[i][j]\text{matrix}[i][j] with matrix[j][i]\text{matrix}[j][i].
2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.

**Advantages**:

- Simple to implement.
- Space complexity is O(1)O(1) as no extra space is used.

---

#### **Approach 2: Rotating Layer by Layer**

1. Divide the matrix into concentric layers.
2. For each layer, perform the rotation by swapping elements in groups of four.

**Advantages**:

- Does not explicitly use transpose and reverse.
- Still O(1)O(1) space complexity.

### **Implementation**

#### **Approach 1: Transpose and Reverse**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        
        // Step 1: Transpose the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Reverse each row
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            reverse(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
        }
    }
};
```

#### **Approach 2: Rotate Layer by Layer**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        
        for (int layer = 0; layer < n / 2; ++layer) {
            int first = layer;
            int last = n - layer - 1;
            
            for (int i = first; i < last; ++i) {
                int offset = i - first;
                int top = matrix[first][i];
                
                // Perform the four-way swap
                matrix[first][i] = matrix[last - offset][first];
                matrix[last - offset][first] = matrix[last][last - offset];
                matrix[last][last - offset] = matrix[i][last];
                matrix[i][last] = top;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Empty Matrix**: Return as is.
2. **Single Element Matrix**: No rotation required.
3. **Non-Square Matrix**: Problem assumes n×nn \times n matrix. For non-square matrices, the approach would differ.

---

### **Time Complexity and Space Complexity**

1. **Time Complexity**: O(n2)O(n^2)
    - Both approaches traverse all elements of the matrix once.
2. **Space Complexity**: O(1)O(1)
    - No extra space used for in-place modification.

### **Key Takeaways from this Problem**

1. Matrix manipulation problems often involve identifying patterns in index transformations.
2. Breaking the problem into steps like transpose and reverse can simplify implementation.
3. Rotating by 90 degrees counterclockwise can be achieved by reversing columns and then transposing.

---

### **Mistakes and Challenges from this Problem**

1. Forgetting to restrict swaps to one side of the diagonal during transposition.
2. Confusing the indices when reversing rows or rotating layers.

---

### **Real-World Application of this Problem**

1. Image manipulation, where rotation of pixel data is required.
2. Geometric transformations in computer graphics.
3. Data transformation in multi-dimensional arrays.
