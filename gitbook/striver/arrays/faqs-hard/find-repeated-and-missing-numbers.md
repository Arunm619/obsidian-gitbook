Let me help document this problem comprehensively.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of size $n$ containing integers from 1 to $n$, find:
- One number that appears twice (repeated number)
- One number that is missing
For example:
- Input: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1]`
- Output: Repeated = 1, Missing = 5

## Intuition

The key insight is that in a perfect array of size $n$, each number from 1 to $n$ should appear exactly once. Any deviation from this pattern indicates either:
- A number appearing twice (repeated)
- A number not appearing at all (missing)

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Brute Force Approach

Count occurrences of each number from 1 to n.

```cpp
vector<int> findMissingRepeating(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int repeating = -1, missing = -1;
    
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if(arr[j] == i) count++;
        }
        if(count == 2) repeating = i;
        else if(count == 0) missing = i;
        
        if(repeating != -1 && missing != -1) break;
    }
    return {repeating, missing};
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: $O(n^2)$
- Space: $O(1)$

### 2. Using Extra Space (Hash Array)

Use a count array to track frequencies.

```cpp
vector<int> findMissingRepeating(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    vector<int> count(n + 1, 0);
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        count[arr[i]]++;
    }
    
    int repeating = -1, missing = -1;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if(count[i] == 2) repeating = i;
        else if(count[i] == 0) missing = i;
    }
    return {repeating, missing};
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(n)$

### 3. Mathematical Approach (Optimal)

Use sum and sum of squares to create two equations.

```cpp
vector<int> findMissingRepeating(vector<int>& arr) {
    long long n = arr.size();
    
    // Calculate S and S^2
    long long S = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
    long long S2 = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6;
    
    long long actualS = 0, actualS2 = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        actualS += arr[i];
        actualS2 += (long long)arr[i] * arr[i];
    }
    
    // x - y = actualS - S
    // x^2 - y^2 = actualS2 - S2
    long long diff = actualS - S;
    long long diff2 = actualS2 - S2;
    
    // x + y = diff2/diff
    long long sum = diff2/diff;
    
    int x = (sum + diff)/2;    // repeating
    int y = x - diff;          // missing
    
    return {x, y};
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(1)$

### XOR based solution


**XOR is associative and commutative:**


- **Associative property**
    
    The order in which numbers are grouped in an operation does not change the result. For example, (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4).
    

- **Commutative property**
    
    The order in which numbers are positioned in an operation does not change the result. For example, 4 + 2 = 2 + 4.
    

Here are some examples of how these properties work: 

- **Commutative property**
    
    If you receive $100 from one friend and $150 from another, the order in which you count the money does not matter. The total amount received will still be $250.
    

- **Associative property**
    
    If you buy 3 packs of 12 cookies, and 4 packs of 9 cookies each, you can calculate the total cookies by grouping them differently. The outcome will not change.



The XOR-based solution is one of the most elegant approaches to find the repeating and missing numbers. Here's how it works:

## Core Concept

The solution leverages two key properties of XOR:
- XOR of a number with itself is 0
- XOR is associative and commutative

## Algorithm Steps

### Step 1: Initial XOR
First, calculate XOR of all array elements and numbers from 1 to n:
```cpp
int xor1 = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    xor1 ^= arr[i];    // XOR all array elements
    xor1 ^= (i + 1);   // XOR with 1 to n
}
```

### Step 2: Find Rightmost Set Bit
Get the rightmost set bit in the XOR result:
```cpp
int set_bit = xor1 & ~(xor1 - 1);
```

### Step 3: Divide Elements
Divide elements into two sets based on the set bit:
```cpp
int x = 0, y = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(arr[i] & set_bit)
        x ^= arr[i];
    else
        y ^= arr[i];
        
    if((i + 1) & set_bit)
        x ^= (i + 1);
    else
        y ^= (i + 1);
}
```

## Why This Works

1. The XOR of all elements gives us $x \oplus y$ where $x$ is the missing number and $y$ is the repeating number[1].

2. The rightmost set bit in this XOR result indicates a position where $x$ and $y$ differ[4].

3. By dividing numbers into two groups based on this bit:
   - One group contains numbers with the bit set
   - Other group contains numbers with the bit not set
   - The missing and repeating numbers will fall into different groups[4].

## Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: $O(n)$ as we only need two passes through the array[2]
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$ as we only use a constant amount of extra space[2]

## Key Advantage

This approach is particularly efficient because it:
- Doesn't require sorting
- Uses constant extra space
- Avoids arithmetic overflow issues that can occur with mathematical approaches[1]

Let me break down this brilliant bit manipulation trick that finds the rightmost set bit.

## Understanding Rightmost Set Bit

Let's analyze `set_bit = xor1 & ~(xor1 - 1)` step by step.

### Visual Example

Consider `xor1 = 12` (in binary: `1100`)

```
Original number (xor1)     = 1100
Subtract 1 (xor1 - 1)      = 1011
Complement ~(xor1 - 1)     = 0100
AND with original          = 0100
```

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **When we subtract 1 from a number:**
   - All bits after rightmost 1 are flipped
   - Rightmost 1 becomes 0
   
   Example for 12 (1100):
   ```
   1100    (original)
   1011    (after subtracting 1)
   ```

2. **When we take complement ~(xor1 - 1):**
   - All bits are flipped
   - Creates a number where all bits before rightmost 1 are flipped
   
   ```
   1011    (xor1 - 1)
   0100    (~(xor1 - 1))
   ```

3. **Final AND operation:**
   - Original number: 1100
   - Complement:      0100
   - Result:          0100

## The Aha Moment

The magic happens because:
1. Subtracting 1 from a number flips all bits after the rightmost 1 (including that 1)
2. Taking complement reverses this pattern
3. When AND-ed with original number, only the rightmost set bit survives

Here's a table showing more examples:

| Number | Binary | After -1 | Complement | Final AND |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 12     | 1100   | 1011     | 0100      | 0100      |
| 10     | 1010   | 1001     | 0110      | 0010      |
| 6      | 0110   | 0101     | 1010      | 0010      |

## Practical Application

```cpp
void printRightmostSetBit(int n) {
    int rightmost = n & ~(n-1);
    cout << "Original: " << bitset<8>(n) << endl;
    cout << "Rightmost: " << bitset<8>(rightmost) << endl;
}

int main() {
    printRightmostSetBit(12);  // 1100 -> 0100
    printRightmostSetBit(10);  // 1010 -> 0010
    printRightmostSetBit(6);   // 0110 -> 0010
    return 0;
}
```

This technique is particularly useful in the XOR solution because:
1. It helps identify a bit position where the missing and repeating numbers differ
2. This bit position can be used to separate numbers into two groups
3. Each group will contain either the missing or repeating number, but not both
