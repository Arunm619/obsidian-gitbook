### **Question**

Given a sorted array `nums`, find the smallest index ii such that $\text{nums}[i] > x.$
If no such index exists, return `nums.size()`.

---

### **Intuition**

The **upper bound** is the first index where the element is strictly greater than xx. Using binary search, we can efficiently locate this index:

1. If $\text{nums[mid]} > x$, the current $\text{mid}$ is a candidate, but smaller indices may also satisfy the condition. Move left to explore.
2. Otherwise, move right, as all indices to the left of midmid cannot satisfy $\text{nums[i]} > x.$

---

### **Solution (Iterative Binary Search)**

We use a binary search to identify the smallest index satisfying the strict inequality. The process is similar to the **lower bound** but adjusted for strict inequality.

---

### **Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int upperBound(vector<int> &nums, int x) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        int result = nums.size(); // Default value if no index satisfies the condition
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > x) {
                result = mid;     // Update result with the current valid index
                high = mid - 1;   // Search the left half
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;    // Search the right half
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Empty Array**: `nums = []` → Return `nums.size() = 0`.
2. **All Elements Smaller or Equal**: xx is greater than or equal to all elements → Return `nums.size()`.
3. **All Elements Greater**: xx is smaller than all elements → Return `0`.
4. **Exact Match**: If xx is present, skip all indices equal to xx and return the next index.

### **Time Complexity and Space Complexity**

1. **Time Complexity**: $O(\log N)$, due to the binary search approach.
2. **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, as no additional space is used.

### **Key Takeaways from this Problem**

- The **upper bound** is closely related to the **lower bound**, but it focuses on strict inequality.
- Efficient handling of sorted arrays often involves variations of binary search.

---

### **Mistakes and Challenges from this Problem**

- Confusing **upper bound** with **lower bound** by not handling strict inequality correctly.
- Failing to correctly update `low` and `high`, which could lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.

---

### **Real-World Application of this Problem**

- **Data Processing**: Finding the first element larger than a threshold.
- **Range Queries**: Identifying the end of a valid range in sorted data.
