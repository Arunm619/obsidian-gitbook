Not a huge fan of the word "**technical debt**", It makes it sound like an engineering problem and subsconciously it gets deprioritised in a PM's head.

I would start by not declaring anything as a technical debt but instead positioning it around impact.

- Will it make the app run faster?  
- Is it going to make it easy to build features in the future?  
- Will it help us leverage modern tech?


Those are the questions that need to be answered and considered.
