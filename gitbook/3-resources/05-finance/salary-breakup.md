[Salary breakup - CTC vs. In hand | De-influencing - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pui5oqqUcRE)

1. **CTC vs. In-hand Salary**:
    
    - CTC represents the total cost incurred by the company for an employee, including various components such as base salary, bonuses, ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans), and other allowances.
    - In-hand salary refers to the actual amount received by the employee after deductions like taxes, and it typically includes only the base salary and other fixed components.
2. **Understanding Salary Components**:
    
    - Base Salary: The fixed amount paid to the employee, typically on a monthly basis.
    - Joining Bonus: A one-time payment received upon joining the company, usually subject to conditions like staying with the company for a certain period.
    - ESOPs: Employee Stock Ownership Plans allow employees to purchase company shares at a discounted price, offering a potential for wealth creation over time.
    - Retention Bonus: A bonus provided to incentivize employees to stay with the company for a specified duration.
    - Performance Bonus: Additional compensation based on the employee's performance against set Key Result Areas (KRAs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
    - Relocation Bonus: A one-time payment provided to cover expenses associated with relocating to a new city for work.
    - Other Allowances: Additional perks such as educational reimbursements, meal vouchers, etc., provided by the company.
3. **Calculating In-hand Salary**:
    
    - In-hand salary is determined by subtracting deductions like taxes from the total CTC.
    - Deductions like income tax reduce the actual amount received by the employee, impacting the In-hand salary.
    - Components like ESOPs may have a vesting period, during which the employee may not have access to the full value.
4. **Understanding Industry Averages**:
    
    - Industry averages often include various components of the CTC, which may not reflect the actual amount received by most employees.
    - Median salary provides a more accurate representation of the typical earnings, as it accounts for outliers and skewed data points.
5. **Social Implications**:
    
    - Revealing high CTC figures can attract more students to colleges, leading to higher fees and increased revenue for the institution.
    - Employees may feel a sense of pride and accomplishment with a high CTC figure, despite the actual In-hand salary being lower.
