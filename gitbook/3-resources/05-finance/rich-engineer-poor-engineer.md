PPF, ETF, FD (some do, not all)
MF don't compound
CAGR - MF 
ETF
NPS 
PPF - 7.1% 
EPF (office) - 8.1%
Economy grows stabilizes, interest rates keep getting down. 
Japan has negative rates. Spend money and improve the economy.


**Inflation reduces wealth** 
1984 - 1Lakh Rs
2016 - 7451 Rs

Beat inflation. If you dont beat, money will erode. 

Hedges against inflation: 
1. Gold (Precious metal)
2. Real estate (Tricky business/ Luck/ Location matters)
3. Stock Market
4. Art (Niche area - Connoisseur to know the real from fake)

Balance is the key. Dont get one good instrument. 

**Time value of money**

Future Value of Money 
Present Value of Money

**Rule of 72**

The Rule of 72 is a financial rule of thumb used to estimate the approximate number of years for an investment to double or debt to halve. The formula is: 

Years to Double (or Halve)= 72/Annual Rate of Return or Interest)

**Back of the Envelope:**

- _Quick estimation method without need for precision
- _Rule of 72 for investment doubling or debt halving._
- _Example: Calculate time using 72/rate_


Time Value of Money  - CAGR and XIRR

Start value - 3/1/2010 - 2000
End Value - 3/7/2017 - 5000

CAGR = (end value / start value) ^(365/days) - 1

Growth rate = 150%
Compound annual growth rate - 13.939%

**XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return):**

- _Meaning:_ Financial function calculating annualized rate of return for irregular cash flows.
    
- _Example:_ Investment with varied inflows/outflows, XIRR computes effective annual return.
    

**Understanding XIRR:**

- Calculates returns when cash flows are irregular.
- Incorporates dates for each cash flow.
- Useful for investments with non-uniform payments.

  Calculate returns in terms of single value. 
  Single compound interest formula, or CAGR or XIRR.

Goal based investing - the framework 

Clearly define the goals. 
Categorise as must-achieve, good to achieve
- Short term (less than 5 years)
- Medium term (5-10 years)
- Long term (10+ years)

	Buy first house 
	Children's education
	Children's marriage
	Foreign trip 
	Buy a luxury car 
	Holiday home
	Diamond ring for wife
	Early Retirement
	Retirement



**Asset Classes**

| Asset           | Expected Return Range    |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Cash            | Negative interest        |
| Fixed Income    | 6% to -9%                |
| Govt Bonds      | 4% to 7%                 |
| Debt Funds      | 6%                       |
| Equity Funds    | 12% (Pre-tax)            |
| Stocks          | SenSex 41-year CAGR      |
| Real Estate     | ?                        |
| Precious Metals | ?                        |
| Derivatives (F&O) | ?                        |

- Don't invest in asset classes you don't understand.
- Don't put all the eggs in one basket
- Don't believe anything your bank's relationship manager tells you.
- Don't build castles in the air - have realistic expectations on returns.


Avoid middle man. Directly buy through source. From the fund house. 
Choose Direct funds. 
Selfish motive is always there. No Altruistic motive. 

Is buying a house an investment ? 

Staying place/ Shelter is not investment. Don't consider that as investment. Don't count that in Net-worth. 

Emotional value - worth buying
Purely for investment - it is not.

Vacant plot vs individual house vs commercial property in well established location vs outskirts - all are different asset class. 
Each have their own quirkiness

Illiquid assets - can't make money in short amount of time. 
Demand and supply will vary. On paper might be high. Reality will be difficult. 

Rental yield for 1 crore is 2.4% which is very low. 
1 crore in bank with FD 4% is 4 lacs

**Goal based investing - Illustration**

Goal X - Save for marriage 5 years from now. Need 20 lacs at today's value. 
Assume inflation - 7% Dont go by historic averages. 
Estimate corpus required - 28 lakhs

List the current value of assets we have now. 5 lakhs

The gap is 23 lakhs. Save 23 in 5 years. 
How much invest in every month? 20K per month. 2.4 lakhs every year. + 5 lakh initially. 

required rate is **19.6%** interest rate. 
This is not reasonable rate of interest. stock market can give but not enough period. 
Fixed instrument - 8% 
5 years is not long enough for high equity exposure. 
Revise the target. 21 lakhs is achievable at 8%

----
**Loss aversion bias.
We don't want to lose what is there. 
We will be more sad when we lose what we have than when we earn something.

More accurate > more achievable > less disappointed.

Money matters - When you lose money much sadder than the happiness when you get more money. 
Loss averse as human beings.

  **Wrap up**
- Decide on appropriate equity- debt exposure. 
	 for goals 15 or more years away  50%-70%
	 for goals 10 or more years away 40%-50%
	 for goals 7 years away 20-30%
- Review your portfolio once or twice a year
- Re-balance your portfolio once a year or max twice. Avoid frequent churn of your portfolio.
- Given the lower returns in Fixed income instruments, exposure to equity is a must. NPS is already exposing you to the market. So better to educate yourself about equities atleast so that you don't lose money.
- All said and done, money isn't everything. Have simple savings strategy. Invest enough in yourself.


Index fund is the safest MF. 
Sensex:
1981 - 100 
2021 - 41k

Japan - ATH - 30 years back. Never been able to catch up since then. Anything can happen. There is a risk. 

Debt - Fixed deposit, Bonds
Not losing money is important. Always rebalance.
