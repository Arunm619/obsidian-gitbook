Two types of people;

- Story Teller - The narrative people


Favored tools 
	for Number Cruncher:
		- Accounting statements 
		- Excel spreadsheets
		- Statistical measures
		- Pricing data
    for Story Teller:
		- Anecdotes (Short amazing story about real person/incident)
		- Experience (own/others)
		- Behavioural evidence

Illusions/Delusions
(False beliefs)
	for Number Cruncher:
		- Precision: Data is precise
		- Objectivity: Data has no bias
		- Control: Data can control reality
	for Story Teller:
		- Creativity cannot be quantified
		- If the story is good, investment will be.
		- Experience is the best teacher.


Goal: Disciplined Story teller and Imaginative number crunchers

Legend about brain: Left brain controls logic and right brain controls creativity 
Use both halves!



From story to number: 
Step 1: Develop a narrative for the business you are evaluating.

Understand the business and create a story about it. 

Step 2: Tell the narrative to see if its possible, plausible and probable.

Story is not a fairy tale. 

3 stages of an idea to company -> Possible, plausible, probable.

Possible lots of things are possible. 
Subset is plausible. Even smaller subset is probable. 
100 : 15 : 5 ratio. 

Step 3: Convert the narrative into drivers of value

Craft part. Show value, show numbers. Connect with story.

Step 4: Connect the drivers of value to a valuation.

Step 5: Keep the feedback loop open.
Hangout with different minded people. Keep Listening. 


Ownership of story. 
Uber - June 2014 
Ferrari - Oct 2015 (just before IPO) Since 1940s.

Step1  : Survey the landscape 

Learn more about the company.
Google search is good to place to start. But not to end. 
Talk to people who use the product, who work at the company. 

Venture capitalists don't value companies. they price it. They buy it low and flip it to someone else at high price.

Bad business: Low revenue growth + Abysmal margins + lots of reinvestment

Part of exclusive club : Reason for ferrari cars purchase
Exclusivity: 7255 in 2014 sold. 


Step 2: Create a narrative for the future
Keep it simple, keep it focussed. only 5 minutes. 

End game : Pathway to making money. 
 No. of users - Nice to have. less important. 
Convert users into profit - more important.


Step 3: Check the narrative against history, economic first principles and common sense.

Impossible:
- Bigger than the total market
- Bigger than the economy
- Profit margin > 100%

Implausible: 
- Growth without reinvestment
- Profits without competition
- Returns without risk 
Improbable
- High Growth and Low Risk 
- High Growth and Low Reinvestment
- Low Risk and High Reinvestment
All high - understandable 
All low - understandable 
high + low - Needs explanation 

Infrastructure companies - toll roads. 
High growth, Low reinvestment - because investment already been made - 10 years later - still revenue flows in

Disruptors vs Disrupted 
Uber vs automotive companies

Runaway stories : Stories that are so good that one is afraid to ask the question, afraid what the answer might be. 
Afraid that the answer would ruin the story and one doesn't ever ask the question


Tesla valuation mistake 
25k to 1.1M car production rate in 10 years 
but no reinvestment set aside 

Oompa loopma valuations have this growth and nothing set aside to create growth.

Every number in this valuation should reflect the part of the story

Earnings/ acquisition: changes story 
Story can be break, shift, changes. 


Apple - Incredible cash machine in history 
derives value from smart phone business which is maturing.

valuations are not spreadsheets and numbers but as stories that evolve over time.

Entrepreneur - Nurture the story and make it bigger over time
Investor - Be skeptical and push back
Observer - Observe whats happening and attach numbers to those stories.

Create the value, claim the value.

Bike racing -> Lead racer -> wind resistance 
Leader - Uber, Side racer -> Lyft 

Amazon -> Field of dreams 
-> Build value -> gain customers 

Favorite book - money ball

Cash burn - Negative cash flow upfront to grow the cash flow in the future

3 words to say openly in investing : I was wrong. 

Automated Selling 
Limit sell. 
Delusional : should i sell now? 
keep going up?
Cant trust yourself. Automate the process. 

Rule of thumb : Stock is undervalued. Buy it. 
Monte carlo simulations. Distribution value. Not point estimates. Trigger point.

Echoes the uncertainty in the prediction part. 
How do I know I made the right assumptions. You never know. 

Pyschological barrier. Used to check the answer after solving math problem. 
Balance sheet balances. Accounting. 
No confirmation mechanism in valuation. Faith. Cant prove it. 

Cant give faith. Only teach mechanism.

Active investing vs Passive investing. Only do active when you enjoy. 

I got lucky. Luck is the dominant paradigm. Both Plus and Minus. 

Behavioural finance. Claim credit when something works. When it doesn't we blame the rest of the world. 

Behave the same when we lose or win. 

Tech companies age in dog years. 
Tech - Old, middle, young age.


Reinvestment: 
You want to grow. what do you have to invest in to grow?

**CapEx - capital expenditure**: the payment with either cash or credit to purchase long-term physical or fixed assets used in a business's operations.


Learnings: 
We pursue the desire to understand so we can control outcomes but luck plays a greater role in life than we want to admit.




**New words:**

1. Status quo: **the current situation** : the way things are now.
2. Rebate: Partial refund
3. six degrees of separation:  _the idea that all people are six or fewer social connections away from each other_.

8. leeway - the amount of freedom to move or act that is available.

9. **Hitting too close to home** -if a remark is close to home, it makes people feel uncomfortable or upset because it is about a sensitive or very personal subject.

10. **Went to hell in a hand basket**: to become completely ruined
11. morbid - horrible, sick, unhealthy.
