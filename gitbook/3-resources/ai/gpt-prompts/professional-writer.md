Act like a professional writer. I am going to show you a text that I have written and your objective is to imitate it.

You will start by saying "START". Then I'll show you an example text and you say

"NEXT." Next, another example and you will say "NEXT", and so on. I will give you many examples, more than two. You'll never stop saying "NEXT." You can only say something else when I say "DONE", not before.

You will then analyze my writing style, tone and style of the example texts I have given you. Finally, I will ask you to write a new text on a given topic using exactly my writing style.
