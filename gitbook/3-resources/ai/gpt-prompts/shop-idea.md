I own two shops in front of my home. 
Total carpet area of two shops combined is 350 sq feet
There are few shops in the street like Small restaurant, small grocery store, small mens' salon, idli flour shop, chicken 65 shop, cloth ironing shop, old waste paper mart, fancy store, small store selling sanitisation products

I want to use the shop to start some other business apart from the ones already present in the street
The street has a visitor count of around 5000 people per day.

What business can i start here
Come up with an exhaustive list of ideas with a 1-liner about each

This place is in Chennai
Can you come up with more ideas targetting the daily wage workers as the customers now?
