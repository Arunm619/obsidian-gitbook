MIT Open Course ware - [How to Speak - YouTube](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY)


Court-marshalling happens when commanders sends the soldiers to field without weapons.
Similar should happen when the students get out of college without the communication skills. The ability to speak, the ability to write and the quality of ideas in that order. 

Quality = f(K, p, t) 
Quality of communication is a function of
K - Knowledge you posses,
p - practice of that knowledge 
t - inherent talent (very small)


K and p is greater than t 
You can get a lot of better than people who have inherent amount of talent if you have right amount of knowledge.


  Examples - armamentarium of speaking technique.
  heuristic/technique - that can get the job.

  non-linear process
  lots of idea
  own repertoire
  max opportunity 
  for people to value and respect your ideas. 

Preamble:
Rule of engagement - No laptops / No phones
Language processor - one for humans

Start a talk with a joke?
JOKE - Not recommended. 

Reason: Beginning of talks
Adjusted to speaking parameters, vocal parameters, not ready. Usually fall flat. 

Rather, Start with a promise. Empowerment promise. 

Best way to start.
Example:
At the end of this 60 minutes, you will know things about speaking you dont know now and something among those things you know now will make a difference in your life. 


Samples of heuristics
1. Cycle on the subject. Go around it. 
	Tell him what you want to tell him. Tell him again. Tell him a third time. as if people weren't intelligent. 
	Reason is 20% will be fogged out. To increase the probability of reaching people more people repeat it three times. 
2. Build fence. Put a fence around you idea so that people will not be confused with something else. 
	Eg. Arun's algorithm is similar to Lekha's algorithm except Arun's is a linear one and lekha's is a constant time one.
3. Verbal punctuation :
   Enumerating and providing numbers. Outlining the ideas, topics and sense that there's a seam in the talk. Since people get fogged out often, give them time to get back on the bus. 
4. Ask questions: How much dead air there can be? 
      I counted 7 seconds. Standard amount of time to wait for answer. 
      Questions have to carefully chosen. If its too easy / obvious, people will be embarassed to say. If its too hard, then no one will know.
  

Put it in armamentarium and build up your repertoire of ideas about presentation

Knowledge base of effective speaking. Create one. Develop own style.


---
Discussion of time and place. 
Good time to have a lecture? 11 AM
Place? 
1. Well Lit.
2. Cased.
3. Reasonably populated.

humans when dimly lighted - go to sleep.
Understand the place better. Prepare for the place.  So no surprises. Check for weirdnessses to deal with it. 
Understand challenges, requirements. 
Imagine all the seats with disinterested farm animals. So no matter how bad it was it wouldn't bad as that. 

Whats going on there must be so much more interesting thing happening elsewhere.
has to be more than half full.  Doesn't have to be packed.

Boards and props and slides
Tools of the trade

Right tool for speaking when the purpose is informing - Board and chalk. 
Right tool for speaking when the purpose is exposing - Slides.

Board - Virtues
1. Graphic quality. Graphics in the presentation. 
2. Speed property. Speed of writing == speed of absorption of data. Speed of flipping thru slides != speed of absorption.
3. Target. Novices tend to pocket their hands or tie their hands in the back. Looks like you conceal a weapon. Point out stuff at the board. (Effective technique)

Props
Custodians of the knowledge about props are the playwrights.

More chalk, less powerpoint. Props are helpful. Props tend to be the thing that are remembered.

Lunatic fringe view. 
 Empathetic mirroring. Physical world.
Slides - Exposing ideas. At job talk/ conference talk.

Extreme examples of how not to use slides

1. Too many paragraph in the slides. 
	Too many words in the slide. And Reading from the slides. Condiments to what you are saying not the main event or opposite way around.

	Important rules. 
	1. Do not read. 
	2. Be in the image. 
	3. Keep images simple. 
	4. Eliminate clutter.
	5. Get rid of background junk.
	6. Get rid of the logos. 
	7. Get rid of the title - Tell the title, doesn't have to be there. Allow the readers to listen to you and dont let the slide compete with you for their attention. Humans only have one language processor (Only one at a time - Read or listen)
	8. Appropriate font size
	9. Avoid laser pointer. Use arrows in the slides only. This is to prevent losing audiences attention.
	10. Have air in the slides, should not be too-heavy or tightly packed.


Epileptic fits

hapex legamenon - something too complex which can be gotten away only once per presentation / per work / per book.

Crimes:
1. Hands in the pocket crime
2. Dim places 
3. Long heavy slides.

Special cases:

Informing 
- Promise 
	- Provide promise upfront 
	- Expressing some passion about what you are talking about.
- Inspiration 
How to inspire people?
- People who encourage 
- People who can show new ways to do things 
- People who exhibit passion about what they do

How to think?
- Blank state 
- story telling animals - Humans
- Understanding and manipulating skills from childhood stories and continue on through professional schools like law, business, medicine, engineering and everything. 

If thats what teaching to think is, then we need 
- Provide them the stories to get started
- Questions to be asked about that stories 
- mechanism for analysing these
- Ways of putting stories together
- ways of analysing how reliable a story is

Persuading 
- Job talks
- Getting famous
Failure to oral exams tend to be mostly due 
- Failure to situate - Research in context 
- Failure to practice

Job talks

what are you looking for in a faculty?
- VISION 
- DONE SOMETHING 
- CONTRIBUTIONS
In 5 mins.
Vision - Problem and Approach.
	Problem that somebody cares about and something new in your approach.
	Problem is the understanding the nature of human intelligence. 
	Approach is asking q about what makes us different from chimpazense and neanderthal? 
	fundamentally different or something better at intelligences.
	
	Symbolic creatures
	relations and events. 
	stories 

Done - Specify a behaviour and enumerate the constraints to make it possible to deal with that behaviour. We have to implement a system because we are engineers. 
Contributions 


Getting famous 
Once you got the job, you need to think a little about how you are going to be recognized for what you do.

why get famous at all?

You get used to being famous. But you never get used to being ignored.

Ideas are like your children and you don't want them to go into the world in rags. 

Techiniques mechanism thoughts 
present ideas to recognize the value in them
so thats why its legitimate thing to concern yourself with packaging.

how to get remembered?

STAR Format SSSSS

Symbol associated with work. 

Slogan - One shot learning 

Surprise - Learn something definite from each example 

Salient idea - Not important. Idea that sticks out. 

Story - How you did it, how it works and why its important. 


How to stop?

Final slide
Final words 

- Recognize the collaborators on the first slides.
- Questions - worst possible way - 20 mins. Squanders real estate. 
- Links - wastes opportunity 
- The end - even worse
- Thank you - all of these lines does nothing. waste opportunities. 
- Conclusions? Good at first. But here's the problem 
	- what you have done?
	- Contributions 
- Final words - Tell a joke. I always end the speech with a joke and people will think they have had fun the whole time.
- Dont let the last words be thank you. It suggests that everybody had stayed there out of politeness and they had a profound desire to be elsewhere. They are polite and they stuck it out. 
- But everyone says thank you? Well, what everybody does is not necessarily the right thing.

God bless you and God bless America.
