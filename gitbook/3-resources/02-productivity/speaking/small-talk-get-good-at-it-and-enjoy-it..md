#### Small talk is a misnomer for such an important part of communication

misnomer - a wrong or inaccurate name or designation

Sports analogy
- Tennis vs balloon touch
It should not be seen like a tennis match where the ball is to be pushed to other side. 
But balloon touch where its both the parties responsibility to keep it up and going.

#### Establish appropriate goals

"Your goal is to be interested. Not interesting."

- We don't have to be really interesting and fascinating
- we just need to be present and be interested in the conversation
- Helps reduce anxiety - as we feel like we are being judged.
- Reality is we are being judged. 
- But play uno reverse and make the spotlight on them.

#### Give yourself permission to pause

- we always think speed is more competence 
- but what is really good competency is appropriate response. 
- Being appropriate can take a little bit of time. Dont be fast. Be correct. 

**Paraphrasing forces you to slow down and listen more carefully.****

 To get some time to think, paraphrasing is a good way. 
 It not only helps in understanding the question properly, but also gives us time to get the right answer.


This is what 5yo does. 

Several things happen in paraphrasing
1. Validation of what other person said. Paraphrasing is not agreeing. It is just saying this is what I heard. It helps validate the content. It helps with fidelity.

	most of us just listen to the gist of what someone says and then start judging, rehearsing and responding. 

Paraphrasing helps in understanding the bottomline of what is said and that helps slow one down.

#### What if you feel like you don't have anything smart to say

There's always something to say. You can always ask a question.

"Tell me more." is a super phrase. 

"Give me some more detail."
"What did you mean about that point?"

Act inquisitively. 

Inquisitive - having or showing an interest in learning things; curious


---

#### What if I say something dumb or make a mistake

Mistakes are common and natural. 

Spontaneous communication is about ***connection*** and not ***perfection***.


Just like in cinematography, People should reframe their mistakes as missed take.

What we did was not wrong, maybe there is another way to do it. Lets do it.

#### What if my problem is that I have too much to say

Many of us (MEEEE) when they are in uncomfortable situations, we just keep talking as we think. We go on too long.
It does act like a defensive technique for them to throw out bunch of stuff and something will stick around and people will think they are smart or they know what they are talking about.

```important
Concision is almost always better in communication
```

Tell me the time don't build me the clock.

#### What tools can I use if none of this natural to me?

- Leverage structure 
- Structure is bullet points. 

**Structure is logical connection of all your ideas**

Recipe or map.

**Leverage structure to make your communication tighter and clearer.****

Three simple questions
- What?
- So what? (Why)
- now what? (What's Next)

This is a magical tool. Practice it. 
By drilling it, it becomes natural. Anything.


----
#### How do I get the conversation started?

 
we always initiate with trite, common phrases.

trite - lack of originality

- how are you?
- what brings you here?
- what do you do?

- "This is amazing to me, There are more people in this room wearing blue shirts than I think I have seen in a long time."
- "You know what? you are right. That's really interesting"
- Conversation is off and running.
 
Notice something in the environment. Be present.

**Try initiating with something that piques curiosity**


 ---
#### Alright, how do I end the conversation (gracefully)?

Getting out >>> getting started

I am hungry, thirsty
Need to go to the bathroom 

Biology is not necessarily the right way to exit.

Rachel Greenwald - White Flag approach

 Just before the last lap, they wave a white flag to indicate that the race is going to be over. 

 The white flag technique to end a small talk: tell them you need to go, but ask one more question to wrap up the convo

Similarly we need to indicate that its going to end soon and let them end with short note without cutting off abruptly.

**Note**

1. be Interested not Interesting 
2. Pause, don't react too quick (Use Paraphrasing) 
3. "Tell me more" 
4. Ok to make mis"take" - Connection not perfection 
5. Be concise - tell the time not tell how to make the clock 
6. Use Structure - a logical connection of your points (What - So What (Why) - Now What (What's Next)) 
7. Curious about something around and start conversation 
8. White flag ending (Tell them it's about to end)
