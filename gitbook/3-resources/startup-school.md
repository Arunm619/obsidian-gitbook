#### How to start a business with no money

Start with your passion. 
Start with what you like. 

Usually passion doesn't generate revenue. That's because we don't have the business mindset yet. 

Original ideas not needed. 
Market gap and niche is not how companies are started. 


School system's lie: 
Get better at what you don't know. Outsource it. 
Get better at what you love doing and master it. 

Get obsessed by it. Figure out what like doing.

Idea - Original idea is not needed. 
Combine forces with others people to make the best of that idea. 

Execution - First thing to do make the business idea to come to life. 
Make it simple. Do not make it hard for you. Get started.

Come up with simple execution plan. 
Consider where the revenue is coming from.
