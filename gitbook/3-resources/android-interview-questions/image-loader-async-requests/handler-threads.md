Sure, we can use `HandlerThread` and `Handler` for the same purpose. Here's how you can modify the `ImageLoader` class to use `HandlerThread`:

```kotlin
import android.os.Handler
import android.os.HandlerThread
import android.os.Message
import java.lang.ref.WeakReference

class ImageLoader {
    private val handlerThread = HandlerThread("ImageLoader").apply { start() }
    private val handler = object : Handler(handlerThread.looper) {
        override fun handleMessage(msg: Message) {
            val request = msg.obj as Request
            val imageViewRef = WeakReference(request.imageView)
            try {
                val bitmapStream = downloadBitmap(request)
                val bitmap = decodeBitmap(bitmapStream)
                imageViewRef.get()?.post {
                    imageViewRef.get()?.setImageBitmap(bitmap)
                }
            } catch (e: IOException) {
                println("Download failed for $request")
            }
        }
    }

    fun load(request: Request) {
        handler.sendMessage(Message.obtain(handler, 0, request))
    }

    fun cancelRequest(request: Request) {
        handler.removeCallbacksAndMessages(request)
    }

    fun cancelAll() {
        handler.removeCallbacksAndMessages(null)
    }

    fun downloadBitmap(request: Request): BitmapStream {
        println("Download started at ${currentTimeMillis()} for $request...")
        sleep((500..2000).random().toLong())
        if ((1..10).random() < 3) {
            throw IOException("Download failed for $request")
        }
        println("Download successful for $request")
        return BitmapStream(request, byteArrayOf())
    }

    fun decodeBitmap(bitmapStream: BitmapStream): Bitmap {
        println("Decode started for $bitmapStream...")
        sleep((100..200).random().toLong())
        println("Decode finished for $bitmapStream")
        return Bitmap(bitmapStream)
    }
}
```

In this code, `HandlerThread` is used to create a background thread, and `Handler` is used to post tasks to that thread. The `handleMessage` method is overridden to handle the image loading tasks. The `load` method posts a new task to the handler, and the `cancelRequest` and `cancelAll` methods remove tasks from the handler.

Please note that `HandlerThread` and `Handler` are not recommended for new projects due to their limitations and potential for leaks. It's recommended to use the `java.util.concurrent` package or `Kotlin Coroutines` for new projects.


----
In Android, `HandlerThread` itself does not support parallelism. It's a simple thread with a `Looper` that can process `Message` or `Runnable` objects sequentially in the order they are received.

If you want to achieve parallelism with `HandlerThread`, you would need to create multiple `HandlerThread` instances. However, managing these threads and coordinating tasks between them can be complex and error-prone.

A better approach for handling parallelism in Android is to use the `java.util.concurrent` package, which provides high-level concurrency constructs like `ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, and `Future`. These constructs are designed to efficiently manage and control thread execution in a concurrent environment.

Another modern alternative is to use Kotlin Coroutines, which are lightweight, efficient, and easy to use for handling asynchronous programming and parallelism. They are now the recommended way to handle asynchronous tasks in Kotlin and Android.

Here's an example of how you can use `ExecutorService` to achieve parallelism:

```kotlin
import java.util.concurrent.Executors

class ImageLoader {
    private val executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2)

    fun load(request: Request) {
        executor.execute {
            try {
                val bitmapStream = downloadBitmap(request)
                val bitmap = decodeBitmap(bitmapStream)
                request.imageView.setImageBitmap(bitmap)
            } catch (e: IOException) {
                println("Download failed for $request")
            }
        }
    }

    fun cancelAll() {
        executor.shutdownNow()
    }
}
```

In this code, `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2)` creates a thread pool with a fixed number of threads (2 in this case). When a task is submitted using `executor.execute`, it is executed on one of the threads in the pool. If all threads are busy, the task waits in a queue until a thread becomes available. The `executor.shutdownNow()` method cancels all in-flight tasks and stops the executor.
