- Worked on Verify CVV issue
- Wrote UTs for PPR (50% of the class is covered) more like an orchestration layer
- Will continue with it today.
- Spoke with Shristhi regarding the wishlist on cart feature. Got the high level idea, will have to check with the SDUI TEAM to see if it can be made possible with any code changes.
