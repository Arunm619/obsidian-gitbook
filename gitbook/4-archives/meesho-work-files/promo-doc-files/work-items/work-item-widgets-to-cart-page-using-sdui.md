### Situation:
Within the checkout module, a strategic assessment identified an underutilized opportunity in the cart page for both "Buy Now" and "Add to Cart" flows. Specifically, there was unexplored real estate at the bottom of the screen that could enhance user engagement. Consequently, a decision was made to integrate dynamic widget functionality into these pages, leveraging this untapped potential.

#### Task:
The task at hand was the seamless integration of dynamic widgets through the adoption of the newly introduced Velocity Widget based on Server Driven UI development principles. This approach was chosen for its real-time flexibility, allowing content and layout modifications without necessitating frequent app updates. The primary objective was to showcase various types of supported widgets, with configurability managed from the backend, effectively optimizing the available space on the cart page.

#### Action:
Our solution involved the incorporation of banners as dynamic widgets on the designated pages. Screenshots were meticulously captured to showcase the banners seamlessly integrated into both the cart page and the instant checkout review cart page. While the initial focus was on banners, the design adhered to SDUI principles, ensuring adaptability for future expansions encompassing various widget types, all dynamically configured from the backend.

#### Result:
The implementation successfully introduced banners as dynamic widgets on the cart page and the instant checkout review cart page. The application of SDUI principles ensures not only immediate success but also provides a robust foundation for ongoing optimization and experimentation, ensuring continued enhancement of user engagement on these critical pages. The achievement was notable for its efficiency, aligning with project timelines.
