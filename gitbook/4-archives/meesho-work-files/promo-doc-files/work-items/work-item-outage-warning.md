#### S - Situation:

As an e-commerce app with a significant user base and high daily transaction volume, we identified a critical challenge related to payment outages. The absence of a detailed incident response plan and proactive customer communication during payment outages posed a potential risk to user satisfaction and transaction success. This prompted the need for a strategic solution to address these deficiencies and enhance the app's resilience to payment outages.

#### T - Task:

To tackle this challenge, our focus was on two key aspects: the development of a comprehensive incident response plan and the establishment of proactive customer communication strategies during payment outages. The task involved understanding the current state of payment option display on Android, optimizing the frequency of API hits to Juspay for outage information, and determining how to convey payment failures effectively to users.

#### A - Action:

The execution involved in-depth collaboration with both the Android development team and Juspay. We analyzed the current Android payment option display process, delved into Juspay's APIs, and formulated a set of open questions to gather essential information. We proposed a refined testing schedule for payment processes, developed a plan for conveying outage messages to users based on Juspay's outage data, and sought answers to critical questions from both Juspay and the Transact backend.

####R - Result:

The result is a comprehensive solution that addresses the identified deficiencies. By implementing a refined incident response plan, optimizing the frequency of API hits to Juspay, and formulating a strategy for conveying outage messages to users, we aim to enhance our app's resilience to payment outages. This strategic approach aligns with our commitment to providing a seamless user experience, minimizing disruptions, and maintaining user trust in our e-commerce platform.
