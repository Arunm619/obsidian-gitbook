##### Situation

The Transact module has a mere 2% unit test coverage, posing risks to code reliability. During the code freeze period, a crucial initiative is to augment unit tests significantly, aiming for a 20% coverage.

##### Task

The task involves crafting comprehensive unit tests for Transact module source code, with a tenfold increase in coverage during the code freeze. The goal is not just numerical, but to enhance code quality, identify potential issues, and fortify the module's robustness.

##### Action

The action plan includes identifying critical functionalities, creating meaningful test cases, and ensuring effective test coverage. The focus is on meaningful tests that contribute to code reliability and act as living documentation.

##### Result

The result is a Transact module with 20% unit test coverage, providing code reliability. Unit tests serve as documentation, aiding understanding and early bug detection. The impact encompasses improved code quality, confident refactoring, regression prevention, and increased developer productivity.
