##### Situation
The onboarding flow in the Meesho app lacked the integration of gender input from users, impacting the overall user experience. The North Star Metric for success is a significant improvement in the Gender Fill Rate, measured against the goal of achieving a 1OA (9 D) metric.

##### Task
Introduce a gender input feature in the onboarding flow, aiming to enhance user engagement and capture essential demographic information. The approach involves two variants: Variant 1, where gender is collected during the initial app installation, and Variant 2, where gender is gathered in subsequent sessions.

##### Action
In Variant 1, users are prompted for gender immediately after selecting their preferred language during app installation. In Variant 2, gender input occurs in a modal during the user's next session. Detailed scenarios for each variant outline user interactions based on language selection and gender input.

##### Result
Anticipate a significant increase in the Gender Fill Rate, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of user demographics. The A/B experimentation plan, tracked through Mixpanel, ensures systematic testing and evaluation of both variants, informing future decisions based on user behavior and preferences.
