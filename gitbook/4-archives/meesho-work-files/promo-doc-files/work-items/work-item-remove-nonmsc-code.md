##### Situation
As the Multi-Supplier Cart (MSC) feature reached its full deployment, an opportunity emerged to refine our Android codebase by eliminating dead code segments.

##### Task
Recognizing the chance for code cleanup and optimization, the task involved identifying and removing non-MSC code sections from our Android application. The objective was to leverage the complete integration of MSC, enhancing code clarity and realizing technical advantages.

##### Action
Systematically, the identified dead code was removed, resulting in a more streamlined codebase and a substantial 150KB reduction in the APK size. This cleanup initiative, closely tied to the widespread adoption of MSC, not only enhanced code readability for our engineering team but also delivered significant technical benefits.

##### Result
The successful removal of non-MSC code not only accomplished our goal of code cleanup but also brought about a noteworthy reduction in the APK size, a critical optimization for our application. Driven by the seamless integration of MSC, this process showcased its efficacy in improving overall code quality, readability, and maintainability. The positive impacts extended beyond code cleanliness, encompassing improved compilation times, enhanced runtime performance, and a reduced security risk footprint. This initiative reflects our commitment to delivering a streamlined, efficient, and secure application experience.
