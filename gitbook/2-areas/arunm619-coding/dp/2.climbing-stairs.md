Basic recursion
```cpp
class Solution {

public:

int climbStairs(int n) {

if (n == 0)

return 0;

if (n == 1)

return 1;

if (n == 2)

return 2;

return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2);

}

};
```


Recursion with memoization (caching)
```cpp
class Solution {

private:

int helper(int n, vector<int>& dp) {

if (dp[n] != -1)

return dp[n];

if (n == 0)

return dp[n] = 0;

if (n == 1)

return dp[n] = 1;

if (n == 2)

return dp[n] = 2;

return dp[n] = helper(n - 1, dp) + helper(n - 2, dp);

}

  

public:

int climbStairs(int n) {

vector<int> dp(n + 1, -1);

return helper(n, dp);

}

};
```


The "Climbing Stairs" problem is a classic problem in dynamic programming. The problem statement is as follows:

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

The intuition behind the solution is that the number of ways to reach the `n`th step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the `(n-1)`th step and the `(n-2)`th step. This is because from the `(n-1)`th step, you can take one step to reach the `n`th step, and from the `(n-2)`th step, you can take two steps to reach the `n`th step.

The two solutions in the code are both based on this intuition, but they use different approaches:

1. **Top-Down Dynamic Programming (Memoization):** The first solution uses a top-down dynamic programming approach, also known as memoization. It uses a helper function that takes `n` and a memoization vector `dp` as arguments. If `dp[n]` is not -1, it returns `dp[n]`. Otherwise, it calculates `dp[n]` as the sum of `helper(n - 1, dp)` and `helper(n - 2, dp)`, and returns `dp[n]`. The `climbStairs` function initializes `dp` and calls the helper function. This approach avoids repeated calculations by storing the results of previous calculations in `dp`. The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n).
    
2. **Naive Recursion:** The second solution uses a naive recursion approach. It directly returns the sum of `climbStairs(n - 1)` and `climbStairs(n - 2)`. This approach does not use any storage to avoid repeated calculations, so it recalculates the same values multiple times. The time complexity is O(2^n) and the space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack.


In comparison, the first solution is more efficient than the second solution because it avoids repeated calculations. However, it uses more space to store the results of previous calculations. If space is a concern, an iterative dynamic programming approach can be used, which has the same time complexity as the first solution but a constant space complexity.



```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2)
            return n;
        int one_step_before = 2;
        int two_steps_before = 1;
        int all_ways = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            all_ways = one_step_before + two_steps_before;
            two_steps_before = one_step_before;
            one_step_before = all_ways;
        }
        return all_ways;
    }
};
```

In this code, `one_step_before` and `two_steps_before` store the number of ways to reach the previous step and the step before the previous step, respectively. In each iteration, `all_ways` is updated to the sum of `one_step_before` and `two_steps_before`, which is the total number of ways to reach the current step. Then `two_steps_before` and `one_step_before` are updated for the next iteration.

This approach has the same time complexity as the previous dynamic programming approach, which is O(n), but it has a constant space complexity, which is O(1), because it only uses a fixed amount of space to store the results of the previous two steps. This makes it more space-efficient than the previous approach.
