Basic recursion
```cpp
long long fib(long long n)

{

if (n <= 0)

return 0;

if (n == 1)

return 1;

return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);

}
```


Recursion with memoization (caching)
```cpp
long long fib(long long n, vector<long long> &dp)

{

if (dp[n] != -1)

return dp[n];

if (n <= 0)

return dp[n] = 0;

if (n == 1)

return dp[n] = 1;

return dp[n] = fib(n - 1, dp) + fib(n - 2, dp);

}
```


The intuition behind this approach is that each Fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding ones, so we can calculate each Fibonacci number iteratively by adding the two preceding numbers.

The performance benefit of this approach is that it only needs to iterate `n` times and only needs constant space to store the two preceding numbers and the current number. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).

This is more efficient than the naive recursive approach, which has a time complexity of O(2^n) due to repeated calculations, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the recursion stack. It's also more efficient than the dynamic programming approach, which also has a time complexity of O(n) but has a space complexity of O(n) to store all Fibonacci numbers up to `n`.

constant space 

```cpp
long long fibBetter(long long n) {
if(n <= 1) return n;
int prev2 = 0, prev = 1;
int curi;
for(int i = 2; i <=n; i ++) {
curi = prev + prev2;
prev2 = prev;
prev = curi;
}

return prev;
}
```
